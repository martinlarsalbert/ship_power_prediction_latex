\section*{DATA}\label{data}
The data used in this study is described in
Tab.\ref{tab:data_files}. There is one result with a pure FNPF
simulation at 0 knots. For model test results, two tests are available
at 0 knots and one test at 15.5 knots. There is also a result at 15.5
with a hybrid method, where semi empirical viscosity has been injected
into the FNPF calculations.
