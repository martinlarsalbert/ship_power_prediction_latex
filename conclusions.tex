\section*{CONCLUSIONS}\label{conclusions}
This dataset is a time series with high autocorrelation, so that the
samples cannot be assumed as independent. This means that randomly
splitting the data into a train and test dataset will overpredict the
accuracy by far. With a time series, training should be done on historic
data to predict the future. This means that the training set must happen
in time prior to the test set, which has been done in this report for
the test evaluation as well as in the cross validation for parameter
tuning.
The Support Vector Regressor seems to be the model that performs the
best. However, none of the models seem to perform very well on this
dataset and the accuracy changes very much with the test size, which
means that the ranking between the models is very unreliable. The
dataset should be further examined and extended with additional features
to enable for a better model fit.
